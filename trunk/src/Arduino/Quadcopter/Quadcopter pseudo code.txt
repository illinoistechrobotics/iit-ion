//Reference frame transformation
//  rotational matrix to shift pitch and roll axis if desired
//  this will simplify computation of human controller information

//Input from human controller

//Manual control loops
//  modify desired kinematic properties based on inputs
//  these target values will modify the targets for stability control loops	

//Reverse reference frame transformation
//  un-shift pitch and roll to simplify stability loop outputs

//Stability control loops
//  based on desired kinematic properties for pitch, roll, yaw, lift
//	each loop will add to current motor values or desired forces
//	We may need to have a priority among these and/or a method for synchronizing them so we don't continually increase motor power
//	Lift may need to be the master, but it has to be done such that it doesn't counter the other loops



//Motor outputs
//	based on modified motor targets from above, determine and set motor outputs
